## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the SIP.-->
This SIP proposes to deprecate the binary options contracts from the Synthetix smart contract suite.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

What are binary options? Binary options enable users to go long or short on specific outcomes around price feeds. Currently, whenver the Synthetix contract suite is deployed the binary options contracts all get deployed along with the rest of the Synthetix contract suite. With the implemenetation of this SIP the binary options contacts would no longer be deployed whenever the Synthetix contract suite is deployed to mainnet.
## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for SIPs that want to change Synthetix. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the SIP solves. SIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Deprecating the contracts from the Synthetix repo grants the Thales team access to make changes as needed, reduces the cost of deploying the Synthetix contract suite, and supports an independent timeline for Thales to deploy binary options contract as required.

I am leading the Thales team to develop a platform for swapping binary options positions on 0x's limit order books with the help of my co-founder Danijel.
The 0x protocol uses off-chain order books and on-chain settlement to enable liquid trading of binary options positions. This is a solution to address a critical shortcoming of the current binary options offering, which can only be swapped via OTC transactions. With an orderbook solution in place users and market makers have a venue for swapping binary options positions.
Since the new project is owning all aspects of the binary options project there is no longer a need for the binary options contracts to be deployed with the rest of the Synthetix smart contracts.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->
The following contracts should be deprecated from the Synthetix repo.

BinaryOptionMarketManager.sol
BinaryOptionMarketFactory.sol
BinaryOptionMarketData.sol
BinaryOption.sol


## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

These are all the contracts touching the binary options offering the in the Synthetix repo. 

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for SIPs but can be included with the implementation..-->

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any SIP is given status "Implemented", but it need not be completed before the SIP is "Approved". While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
